## Hi there 👋

I am Andres, a software engineer from Mexico. I am passionate about technology.

I do not like to stay in my comfort zone. However, I recently realized I have been doing that for a while now.
Therefore, I have deicided to dig deeper into the technologies that I use on a daily basis, so I can understand them better and master them.
